Circuit CNF benchmarks from TG-Pro

TG-Pro converts ISCAS85 and ISCAS89 benchmark circuits in .bench format to DIMACS CNF files. The sequential circuits are converted into combinational circuits. No constraint of ATPG problems are added to these benchmarks, only the original circuits are converted.
